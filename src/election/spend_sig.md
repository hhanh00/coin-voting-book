# Spend Signature

The Election Authority can decide to accept
*unsigned* notes from the voters.

```admonish warning
This reduces security since the *spending
key* is no longer necessary for voting.
```

However, the *full viewing key* is still
needed.

Allowing unsigned votes has the advantage
of not requiring coins to be retrieved from
cold storage.
