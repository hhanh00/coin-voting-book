# Vote Counting & Audit

At the end of the election, the Election Authority
releases the full viewing keys of the candidate
addresses.

This allows anyone to trial decrypt and
decipher the votes for the candidates.

The Election Authority publishes the election report.

## Audit

In additional to checking the results,
the complete list of transaction data
is available for download from the Voting Server.

This allows auditors (or any user) to verify
that the election was carried out correctly
(no double voting, no unregistered votes, 
no counterfeit votes, etc.)
