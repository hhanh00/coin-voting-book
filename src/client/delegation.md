# Delegation

Once the Snapshot height is reached, the Voting Server VS
will start building an alternate Blockchain with just
the election ballots.

> Delegates must monitor the new Blockchain which is
downloadable through one of the VS RPC endpoints.

If they find output notes that gives them Voting Power,
they can use it to vote for a candidate (or delegate to
another user).
